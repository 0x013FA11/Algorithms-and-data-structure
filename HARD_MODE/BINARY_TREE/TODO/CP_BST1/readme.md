Problem Statement:

You are given a binary search tree (BST) and a linked list. The BST is constructed such that for each node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the value of all nodes in its left subtree and less than or equal to the value of all nodes in its right subtree. The linked list is a sequence of distinct integers.

Your task is to perform the following operations:

Insertion: Given an integer x, insert it into the BST. If x is already in the BST, do nothing. If x is not in the BST, insert it at the correct position to maintain the BST property.
Search: Given an integer x, search for it in the BST. If x is in the BST, return the node containing x. If x is not in the BST, return NULL.
Deletion: Given an integer x, delete the node containing x from the BST. If x is not in the BST, do nothing.
Linked List Conversion: Convert the BST into a doubly linked list. The doubly linked list should have the same order of elements as the in-order traversal of the BST. The left pointer of the first node in the list should point to NULL, and the right pointer of the last node in the list should also point to NULL.
Linked List Conversion: Convert the doubly linked list back into a BST. The BST should have the same order of elements as the in-order traversal of the list.
Constraints:

The BST and the linked list can contain up to 10^5 nodes.
The value of each node in the BST and the linked list is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
Input:

The first line of the input contains the number of operations to perform.
For each operation, the first line contains the operation type (INSERT, SEARCH, DELETE, CONVERT_BST_TO_LIST, CONVERT_LIST_TO_BST).
If the operation is INSERT, the second line contains the integer to insert.
If the operation is SEARCH, the second line contains the integer to search for.
If the operation is DELETE, the second line contains the integer to delete.
Output:

For each SEARCH operation, print the value of the node found. If no node is found, print NULL.
For each CONVERT_BST_TO_LIST operation, print the elements of the list in the order they appear in the list.
For each CONVERT_LIST_TO_BST operation, print the elements of the BST in the order they appear in the BST.
This problem is complex because it requires understanding and implementing both binary search trees and linked lists, and it also requires converting between the two data structures. It's a good problem for a senior competitive programmer to practice their skills in data structures and algorithms.
